                    <h3>Bosque de Piedras de Cumbemayo</h3>
                    <p>Located just 19 kilometers southeast of the city and due to erosion, these rocks of volcanic origin have been molded into a kind of tree trunk shape close to each other, which makes them look like a stone forest.
                        Many people see in them something similar to hooded friars, which is why they have been baptized as frailones. If you are one of the people who likes extreme sports, you can go climbing.</p>

                    <h3>Baños del Inca</h3>
                    <p>Main tourist reference for hot springs in Peru; recreational complex just 6 kilometers from the historic center of Cajamarca, with dozens of therapeutic wells for the relaxation of Peruvian and foreign families. A rich sensation both muscular and psychological!

                        Behind the long rock curtain of the mountain range is Baños del Inca, a famous recreational center in Cajamarca with thermal waters rich in healing properties; a trip to the past and a review of the history of Peru, but within comfortable facilities.</p>

                    <h3> Mirador del Cerro Santa Apolonia</h3>
                    <p>So that you can have a global view of the city of Cajamarca , a little to the south and east of the main square is the Santa Apolonia hill, at the top of which you can find the viewpoint of the same name, to get to it you have to climb several stairs.
                        At its summit is also its chapel, in this place the day of the Virgin of Fátima is celebrated every May 13, in addition, its construction will surprise you with its platforms and underground structures , which were used in the years 1,200 BC as tombs of the Chavín culture, in which people who were considered important in the region were buried.</p>
